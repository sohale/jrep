A new generation `grep` written in node/javascript.

Very useful for bash scripting and devops works.
Very handy and extermly flexible.

## Usage
```bash
jrep  <filter1>  <filter2> ...
```

* Each `<filter>`
  * is a string transformation (a *map* callback)
  * is the body of a **javascript** function with arg `x`
* The <filter>s are applied sequentially on each line in the piped content.
* In case of exception in any of the <filter>s, that line is removed.

**Find jrep1 on npm: [jrep1](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jrep1)**
